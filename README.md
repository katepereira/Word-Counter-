# Word-Counter

## **Project Overview**

The **Word Counter Program** is a Python-based application that allows users to count the number of words in a given sentence or paragraph. The program provides a user-friendly menu with two options:

1. Count the number of words.  
2. Exit the program.

This program runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit, ensuring continuous interaction. It serves as a great example of implementing basic control flow, input handling, and modular programming in Python.

- Uses Python's `split()` method to accurately count words in the input text.

### **Error Handling**
- Handles empty inputs gracefully by prompting the user to enter valid text.

### **Infinite Loop**
- The program continues running until the user explicitly chooses to exit.

### **User-Friendly Interface**
